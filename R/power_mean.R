#' Power mean of vector elements
#' 
#' \code{power_mean()} calculates the power mean of a set of values.
#' 
#' @param values Values for which to calculate mean.
#' @param order Order of power mean.
#' @param weights Weights of elements, normalised to 1 inside function.
#'
#' @details Calculates the order-th power mean of a single 
#' set of non-negative values, weighted by weights; by default, weights are 
#' equal and order is 1, so this is just the arithmetic mean. Equal weights 
#' and a order of 0 gives the geometric mean, and an order of -1 gives the 
#' harmonic mean.
#' 
#' @return Weighted power mean
